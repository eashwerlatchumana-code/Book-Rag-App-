1. Test1_ragapp, is my file where I built the rag app functions I built from scratch.

2. 'Withimport' file and the 'Ragappfunctions' file was then my later version, where I defined the functions for each process: adding a doc, making it into chunks, uploading to the vectordb, etc.
3. I did this so I can reuse the defined functions to build the rag app from Scratch
4. Note my pdf that I used 'shortstory' is in the Co-Op folder, and my code files are in the code-files
5. Also another thing, while using the langchain functions, I have used depreciated functions, therefore when running the code, you do get a langchain warning; but this does not impact the code functionality!
